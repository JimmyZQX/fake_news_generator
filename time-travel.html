    <h1>Scientists Confirm Time Travel is Real</h1>
    <p>Physicists at a top-secret research facility have announced the first successful experiment in time travel. Using quantum entanglement and wormhole theories, they claim to have sent a small particle one second into the past.</p>
    <p>While practical time travel for humans is still theoretical, experts suggest that this discovery could revolutionize physics and our understanding of time itself.</p>
